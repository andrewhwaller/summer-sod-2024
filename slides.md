# Matthew 6:9–13

“Pray then like this: 

Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. 

Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. 

Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. 

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.”

# Matthew 26:36--46

Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, “Sit here, while I go over there and pray.” And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. Then he said to them, “My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me.” And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, “My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.” And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, “So, could you not watch with me one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.” Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done.” And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners...”

<!--
* Notable here is Jesus effectively putting into practice what he has taught his disciples.
The "our father" of Matt 6 is organically connected to the "my father" of Matt 26. 
    * Jesus doesn't have one way of praying that is unique to him and some *other* way of praying that he teaches his disciples.
    We are taught to approach God like Jesus does.
* Question: how would you characterize Jesus's relationship to "God's will" in this context?
    * Perhaps more pointedly, what example does Jesus set for us in this passage?
    * Is this similar to or different from the way we typically think about God's will?

# 1 Peter 4:1--6

Since therefore Christ <span v-mark="{ color: '#f72f47', type: 'circle', strokeWidth: 3, padding: 10 }">suffered in the flesh</span>, arm yourselves with the <span v-mark="{ color: '#f72f47', type: 'circle', strokeWidth: 3, padding: 10, at: 2 }">same way of thinking</span>, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin, so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for <span v-mark="{ color: '#f72f47', type: 'underline', strokeWidth: 3, at: 3 }">the will of God.</span> For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do...; but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead. For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.

<!--
* In praying a prayer like his, we should also have a mindset like his.
* Because Christ suffered in the body, we who are united to him have access to “the mind of Christ” and are empowered to participate in his suffering and die a death like his unto sin such that we are no longer governed by sin but by the will of God.

# Philippians 2:5--13

Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself, by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore God has highly exalted him .... Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.

# How can we, specifically and particularly, know God's will?

<!--
* It's one thing to say that we have access to the mind of Christ, but it's another thing to discern how we should obey God's will in our own lives.
* We can't wave the magic wand of "union with Christ" and do away with the need to pursue obedience to God.

# Romans 12:1--2

I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you _may discern what is the will of God_, what is good and acceptable and perfect.

<!--
* Our corporate worship of God is not all the worship that we must perform.
* Our worship together shapes us into people who continue to worship God by doing his will and honoring him with our lives.
* We know God's will because we are part of a worshipping community that is being transformed by the Holy Spirit.
* We pray this prayer together every week because we need God to do this work of transformation.
    * We need God to both accomplish his will in the world and also grow us in holiness and obedience so that we do his will in our own lives.

# The prayer “on earth as it is in heaven” is realized because Christ, the man from heaven, accomplished the Father's will on earth.

<!--
* We are now empowered by the Holy Spirit to obey God's law and live out lives of repentance and service.
